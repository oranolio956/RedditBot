## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Protocols

### Flood Wait Handling
When encountering FloodWait errors:
1. **Immediate**: Stop all activity
2. **Wait**: Full duration + 10%
3. **Resume**: At 50% normal rate
4. **Monitor**: For 2 hours
5. **Normal**: Return to normal if stable

### Spam Detection Response
If spam warning received:
1. **Stop**: Halt all messaging
2. **Review**: Check last 10 messages
3. **Adjust**: Modify message patterns
4. **Test**: Send 1 test message
5. **Resume**: Gradually increase activity

### Emergency Stop Procedure
```bash
# Emergency stop single account
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/telegram/accounts/{account_id}/emergency_stop

# Stop all accounts
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/telegram/emergency/stop_all

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/telegram/accounts/{account_id}/status
```

## ü§ù Community Management

### Joining New Communities

#### Pre-Join Checklist
- [ ] Community has >100 members
- [ ] Not a spam/scam group
- [ ] Relevant to account persona
- [ ] Check group rules
- [ ] Verify no bot restrictions

#### Join Protocol
1. **Search**: Find community via search or link
2. **Observe**: Read last 50 messages
3. **Join**: Use natural timing (not instant)
4. **Lurk**: 24-48 hours before first message
5. **Engage**: Start with reactions, then messages

### Engagement Strategies

#### Lurker Phase (Days 1-3)
- Read messages only
- No interactions
- Learn community culture
- Identify key members

#### Participant Phase (Days 4-10)
- React to 2-3 messages/day
- Send 1-2 relevant messages
- Reply to direct questions
- Share helpful content

#### Contributor Phase (Days 11-30)
- 3-5 messages/day
- Start conversations
- Help other members
- Share valuable insights

#### Leader Phase (Day 30+)
- Regular valuable contributions
- Recognized by community
- Natural influence
- Maintain reputation

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Message Timing Optimization
```python
# Optimal message timing patterns
PEAK_HOURS = [9, 12, 15, 18, 21]  # Local time
NORMAL_HOURS = [10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20]
LOW_HOURS = [7, 8, 22, 23]
INACTIVE_HOURS = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Response delays (seconds)
IMMEDIATE: 2-10 (10% of responses)
QUICK: 10-60 (40% of responses)
NORMAL: 60-300 (40% of responses)
DELAYED: 300-1800 (10% of responses)
```

### Natural Behavior Patterns
- Typing speed: 8-25 characters/second
- Read time: 200-400 words/minute
- Thinking pause: 3-10 seconds before typing
- Error rate: 1-2% typos (auto-corrected)
- Activity variation: ¬±30% daily

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Account Won't Authenticate
```bash
# Check API credentials
echo $TELEGRAM_API_ID
echo $TELEGRAM_API_HASH

# Verify phone number format
# Correct: +1234567890
# Wrong: 1234567890, (123) 456-7890

# Clear session and retry
rm sessions/{account_id}.session
python scripts/telegram_init.py
```

#### High Risk Score
```bash
# Check recent events
curl http://localhost:8001/monitoring/safety/{account_id}?days=1

# Common causes:
- Too many messages too quickly
- Joining groups too fast
- Sending similar messages
- Operating during inactive hours

# Recovery:
1. Pause for 24 hours
2. Resume at 25% capacity
3. Gradually increase over 3 days
```

#### Session Expired
```bash
# Re-authenticate
python scripts/telegram_reauth.py --account-id {account_id}

# If persistent:
1. Check 2FA settings
2. Verify phone number active
3. Check for account restrictions
```

## üìà Analytics & Reporting

### Daily Report Generation
```bash
# Generate daily report
python scripts/generate_report.py --date today

# Custom date range
python scripts/generate_report.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31

# Export formats
--format json  # JSON data
--format csv   # CSV spreadsheet
--format pdf   # PDF report
```
