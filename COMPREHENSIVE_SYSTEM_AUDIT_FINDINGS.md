## üéØ THE BIGGEST ISSUE: FRONTEND CONFUSION

### What You Think You Have:
- "Frontend wired in together"
- "Super easy to understand and use design"
- User-facing application

### What Actually Exists:
- **Backend-only API server**
- **Telegram bot interactions only**
- **No web interface whatsoever**
- **No mobile app implementation**

### The Reality Gap:
```yaml
Expected: Full-stack application with React frontend
Reality: Backend API with Telegram bot only
Gap: 100% of frontend missing
```
