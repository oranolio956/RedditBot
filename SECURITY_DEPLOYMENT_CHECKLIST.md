## üîß Security Tools and Scripts

### Migration Scripts
```bash
# Migrate secrets from .env to encrypted storage
python scripts/migrate_secrets.py --dry-run
python scripts/migrate_secrets.py --backup
```

### Security Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive security validation
python scripts/security_validation.py --verbose
python scripts/security_validation.py --report security_report.json
```

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test authentication endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"telegram_id": 12345, "auth_date": 1640995200, "hash": "test_hash"}'

# Test protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test webhook signature verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/telegram \

```

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy production configuration
cp .env.production.example .env.production

# Set up encrypted secrets
USE_ENCRYPTED_SECRETS=true python scripts/migrate_secrets.py

# Validate security
python scripts/security_validation.py
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Create admin user
python -c "from app.core.auth import UserRole; print('Add admin Telegram IDs to TELEGRAM_ADMIN_USERS')"
```

### 3. Security Verification
```bash
# Final security check
python scripts/security_validation.py --report final_security_report.json

# Verify all endpoints require authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/ # Should return 401

# Test webhook security
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/telegram # Should return 401
```
