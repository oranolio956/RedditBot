    return {"status": "received"}

# After: Complete verification
@app.post("/webhook/telegram")
async def telegram_webhook(request: Request):
    # Verify signature
    if not await verify_telegram_webhook(request, require_signature=True):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid signature")
    
    # Rate limiting
    if await auth_manager.rate_limit_check(f"webhook:{client_ip}", 60, 60):
